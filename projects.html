            <h3>Text Based Chess</h3>
            <p>
                Created a fully functional text base chess game using Java. During each turn, the player's current turn will indicate the piece they want to move
                and the new grid they want to move it to. After each move, the current board is printed. The game includes all basic chess functionalities, 
                including key chess features such as proper moving of pieces, check, checkmate, as well as special moves such as en pessant and castling. 
            </p>
            <h3>Cache Simulator</h3>
            <p>
                Created a program in C that simulates the sending and retrieval of data via caching. The code supports two levels of caching, and includes
                both Least Recently Used (LRU) and First in First Out (FIFO) functionalities.
