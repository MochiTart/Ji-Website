            My love for programming began with video games. Growing up, one of the primary ways my sister and I bonded was by playing Pokemon on an old gameboy
            advance. From there, my love for video games blossomed. Where I couldn't get all the toys I wanted, the internet was full of free video games that 
            you could find online. To this day, video games remain as one of the primary ways I spend my free time and bond with other friends.

            As I began to decide what I wanted to do for a living, I felt like I had to do something related to one of my favorite hobbies. This curiosity 
            naturally led me to programming, and was reinforced by my participation in the 2018 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. There, I had my first 
            exposure to coding while working and bonding over bugs with a group of amazing girls. From there, I decided to major in computer science, where I 
            have taken courses that have continued to challenge my way of thinking. In my time learning from my courses, my interest in programming has expanded
            from just video games to a wide variety of software development.

            There’s something magical about watching the simple lines of code I’ve written turn into a full-blown working product. In a past internship, I spent
            a few months writing several programs that helped automate various manufacturing processes. Being able to apply the knowledge I’ve learned in my 
            classes to a more practical environment has helped tremendously in the way I logically approach problems and design algorithms.
